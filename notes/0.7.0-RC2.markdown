* Powerful new support for extremely large rasters through tiled raster data classes
* New map/reduce-style definition of operations for data parallelism on large raster data
* Support for a range of new raster data types for efficient memory utilization and performance improvements
* Significant speed improvements through lazy evaluation
* Improved geoprocessing operation hierarchy and operation naming scheme
* Modernized benchmark structure with many new performance benchmarks, including tiled raster tests
* First class support for floating point raster data values, with:
    + floating point raster interface
    + support in core operations for floating point values
    + implementation of floating point ARG formats
* The [getting started documentation](azavea.github.com/geotrellis/getting_started/GeoTrellis.html) has been significantly expanded and improved
* Executable GeoTrellis tools can now be installed via conscript
* The GeoTrellis template has moved to the github repository geotrellis.g8, and
  can now be installed using giter8
