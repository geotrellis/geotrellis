[ ] Check out the `master` branch and ensure it contains all commits to be released

[ ] Update CHANGELOG.md and version.sbt to the release version as a single commit to `master`. [Example](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/commit/e8fbbe2668aa0e99b7a631e9dc7802bc270c2bda)

[ ] Create a new tag at the previous commit with `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`

[ ] Push the tag to `locationtech/geotrellis` with `git push --tags`

[ ] Follow the instructions in the setup section of [publish/README.md](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/publish/README.md#setup) to ensure that your local environment is configured for publishing the release

[ ] Set the `RELEASE_TAG` variable in `./publish/Makefile` to `vX.Y.Z`, substituting x/y/z for the current release version

[ ] **Before Continuing:** Ensure you have pushed the tag you created in step 3 before continuing. Otherwise the next step will fail.

[ ] Execute `make build` in `./publish` to build the release container

[ ] Execute `make publish` in `./publish` to build and push release artifacts to Sonatype. This will take an hour or so.

[ ] Go to https://oss.sonatype.org and follow the [Releasing the Deployment](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html) instructions to actually publish the release to Maven. Before clicking "publish" ensure that artifacts were generated for each scala version + geotrellis package combination supported by the release.

[ ] Update `version.sbt` with the new SNAPSHOT version to begin publishing and add an empty `[Unreleased]` section to the CHANGELOG.md. Commit as as a single commit directly to the `master` branch. Typically you only need to increment the bugfix version. [Example](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/commit/be47659e533f771bf9ffba54d59fca3cdcb4bf16)

[ ] Push the previous commit to `locationtech/geotrellis` directly.

[ ] Create a new [GitHub Release](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/releases/new). Include the CHANGELOG entries for the release in the release notes, and state if the release breaks binary compatibility. [Example](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/releases/tag/v3.4.0)
