## Get started with the template project

We have provided a sample project that provides a template for creating a 
geoprocessing web service with GeoTrellis.  It is a blank 
slate for your own 
development that provides a development environment that is set up
with the necessary dependencies in place, making it a little easier to get started.  
The project loads GeoTrellis as a
library, includes some basic configuration, and has a very simple "hello world" 
web service in place for you 
to edit.

If you are a first time user, you may want to use the template along with the tutorial
included in this documentation to start exploring how to build your own geoprocessing service.  If you're new to Scala, you'll need to choose a text editor for editing Scala, but
you won't need to install Scala or any other files to get started.  The following 
instructions assume you are running under Linux or OS X.

Look at the [template project README](https://github.com/azavea/geotrellis-template) for step by step instructions.
