## Get started with the template project

We have provided a sample project that provides a template for creating a 
geoprocessing web service with GeoTrellis. It is a blank slate for your own
development that provides a development environment that is set up with the
necessary dependencies in place, making it a little easier to get started.

The project loads GeoTrellis as a library, includes some basic configuration,
and has a very simple "hello world" web service in place for you to edit.
The template contains [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/azavea/geotrellis-template).

If you are a first time GeoTrellis user, you can use this template with the
tutorial included in this documentation to start exploring how to build your
own geoprocessing service.
