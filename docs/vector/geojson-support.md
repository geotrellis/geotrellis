# Parsing geojson in geotrellis.vector.io.json

Say you’re looking to go from a string to a feature collection
object. This task involves a number of steps and requires
keeping track of a few implicits.

Ultimately, you want to move from a (valid, geojson) string to
a scala representation.

```Scala
val x: String = """{
                  |  “type”str: “FeatureCollection”,
                  |  “features”: [
                  |    {
                  |      “type”: “feature",
                  |      “geometry”: { “type”: “Point”, "coordinates”: [1.0, 2.0] },
                  |      “properties”: { “SomeProp": 14 }
                  |      “id”: “target_12a53e"
                  |    }, {
                  |      “type”: “feature",
                  |      “geometry”: { “type”: “Point”, "coordinates”: [2.0, 7.0] },
                  |      “properties”: { “SomeProp": 5 }
                  |      “id”: “target_32a63e"
                  |    }
                  |  ]
                  |}""".stripMargin
```

For example, `JsonFeatureCollectionMap.getAllFeatures[PointFeature[SomeProp]]`
should evaluate to:

```Scala
Map(
  ("target_12a53e" -> PointFeature(Point ( 1.0 2.0 ), SomeProp( 14 ))),
  ("target_12a53e" -> PointFeature(Point ( 2.0, 7.0 ), SomeProp( 5 )))
)
```

1. First, parse a string as a bit of json. For this (`parseGeoJson`)
is an implicit method on String that is added when you `import geotrellis.vector._`. `parseGeoJson` takes
one type parameter. You'll use `geotrellis.vector.json.JsonFeatureCollectionMap`
in this case, since your geojson has IDs which you'll want to keep. This
class represents IDs as keys to corresponding features.
```Scala
val jsonFeatureMapping = jsonString.parseGeoJson[geotrellis.vector.json.JsonFeatureCollectionMap]
```

2. Once the string (which must be valid geojson!) is parsed, it is
time to query your JsonFeatureCollection for its points:

```Scala
jsonFeatureMapping.getAllFeatures[PointFeature[SomeProp]]
```

Note the use of a `Feature` type parameter and a type parameter on
that PointFeature. This is necessary so that the properties on your
feature can be properly encoded as Scala objects. See
`geotrellis.vector.json.FeatureFormats` for the implicits which use
said type parameterization.
