##Features and Geometries

In addition to working with raster data, Geotrellis provides
a number of facilities for the creation, representation, and
modification of vector data. The data types central to this
functionality (`geotrellis.vector.Feature` and
`geotrellis.vector.Geometry`) correspond - and not by accident -
to certain objects found in [the GeoJson spec](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html).
`Feature`s correspond to the objects listed  under `features`
in a geojson `FeatureCollection`. `Geometry`s, to `geometries`
in a geojson `Feature`.

##Geometries

The base `Geometry` class can be found in `Geometry.scala`.
Concrete geometries include:
- `geotrellis.vector.Point`
- `geotrellis.vector.MultiPoint`
- `geotrellis.vector.Line`
- `geotrellis.vector.MultiLine`
- `geotrellis.vector.Polygon`
- `geotrellis.vector.MultiPolygon`
- `geotrellis.vector.GeometryCollection`

Working with these geometries is a relatively straightforward
affair. Let's take a look:

```scala
import geotrellis.vector._
/*
 * First, let's create a Point. Then, we'll use its intersection method.
 * Note: we are also using intersection's alias '&'.
 */
val myPoint = Point(1.0, 1.1) // Create a point
// Intersection method
val selfIntersection = myPoint intersection Point(1.0, 1.1)
// Intersection alias
val nonIntersection = myPoint & Point(200, 300)
```

At this point, the values `selfIntersection` and `nonIntersection`
are `GeometryResult` containers. These containers are what many JTS
operations on `Geometry` objects will wrap their results in. Source
for the To idiomatically destructure these wrappers, we do the following:

```scala
def unwrapPoint(res: PointGeometryIntersectionResult): Option[Point] =
  res match {
    case PointResult(point) => Some(point)
    case _ => None
  }
// Et voila:
assert(unwrapPoint(selfIntersection) == Some(myPoint))  // Either some point
assert(unwrapPoint(nonIntersection) == None)  // Or nothing at all
```

Beyond the methods which come with any `Geometry` object there are
implicits in many geotrellis modules which will extend Geometry
capabilities. For instance, after importing `geotrellis.vector.io.json._`,
it becomes possible to call the `toGeoJson` method on any `Geometry`:
```scala
import geotrellis.vector.io.json._
assert(Point(1,1).toGeoJson == """{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.0,1.0]}""")
```
If you need to move from a geometry to a serialized representation or
vice-versa, take a look at the `io` directory's contents. This naming
convention for input and output is common throughout Geotrellis.
So if you're trying to get spatial representations in or out of your
program, spend some time seeing if the problem has already been solved.

Methods which are specific to certain subclasses of `Geometry` exist too.
For example, `geotrellis.vector.MultiLine` is implicitly extended by
`geotrellis.vector.op` such that this becomes possible:
```scala
import geotrellis.vector.op._
val myML = MultiLine.EMPTY
myML.unionGeometries
```

The following packages extend `Geometry` capabilities:
- [geotrellis.vector.io.json](io/json/)
- [geotrellis.vector.io.WKT](io/WKT/)
- [geotrellis.vector.io.WKB](io/WKB/)
- [geotrellis.vector.op](op/)
- [geotrellis.vector.op.affine](op/affine/)
- [geotrellis.vector.reproject](reproject/)

##Features
The `Feature` class is odd. At first blush, it thinly wraps one of the
afforementioned `Geometry` objects along with some type of data. Its
purpose will be clear if you can keep in mind the importance of the
geojson format of serialization which is now ubiquitous in the GIS
software space. It can be found in `Feature.scala`.

Let's examine some source code so that this is all a bit clearer.
From `geotrellis.vector.Feature.scala`:
```scala
abstract class Feature[D] {
  type G <: Geometry
  val geom: G ; val data: D
}

case class PointFeature[D](geom: Point, data: D) extends Feature[D] {type G = Point}
```
These type signatures tell us a good deal. Let's make this easy
on ourselves and put our findings into a list.
- The type `G` is [some instance or other](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/upper-type-bounds.html)
of `Geometry` (which we explored just above).
- The value, `geom`, which anything the compiler recognizes as a
`Feature` must make available in its immediate closure must be of type `G`.
- As with `geom` the compiler will not be happy unless a `Feature` provides `data`.
- Whereas, with `geom`, we could say a good deal about the types of
stuff (only things we call geometries) that would satisfy the compiler,
we have nothing in particular to say about `D`.

Our difficulty with `D` is compounded by the fact that the
`Point`-focused feature, `PointFeature` makes good on `geom`
by using `Point` (which is one of the concrete instances of `Geometry`
introduced above) while telling us nothing at all about `data`'s type.
Let's look at some code which does something with D (code which calls
one of D's methods) so that we know what to expect. Remember: types are
just contracts which the compiler is kind enough to enforce for us. In
well-written code, types (and type variables!) can tell us a great deal
about what was in the head of the author.
There's only one package which does anything with `D`, so our job
should be relatively easy. From `geotrellis.vector.io.json.FeatureFormats.scala`:

```Scala
def writeFeatureJson[D: JsonWriter](obj: Feature[D]): JsValue = {
  JsObject(
    "type" -> JsString("Feature"),
    "geometry" -> GeometryFormat.write(obj.geom),
    "properties" -> obj.data.toJson
  )
}
def readFeatureJson[D: JsonReader, G <: Geometry: JsonReader, F <: Feature[D]](value: JsValue)(create : (G, D) => F): F = {
  value.asJsObject.getFields("type", "geometry", "properties") match {
    case Seq(JsString("Feature"), geom, data) =>
      val g = geom.convertTo[G]
      val d = data.convertTo[D]
      create(g,d)
    case _ => throw new DeserializationException("Feature expected")
  }
}
```

`D`'s purpose is clear: any `D` which comes with the tools
necessary for json serialization and deserialization will suffice.
In effect, `data` corresponds to the "properties" member of the
geojson spec's Feature object.

If you can provide the serialization tools (almost certainly implicit
conversions between some case class and [spray json](https://github.com/spray/spray-json)),
the `Feature` object in `geotrellis.vector` does the heavy lifting
of embedding your (thus serializable) data into the larger structure
which includes a geometry. There's even support for geojson IDs: the
"ID" member of a geojson Feature is represented by the keys of a `Map`
from `String` to `Feature[D]`. Data in both the ID and non-ID variants
of geojson Feature formats is easily transformed.

##GeoTrellis Extents

There's one more piece to the `geotrellis.vector` puzzle: `Extent`.
A `geotrellis.vector.Extent` is nothing more than a rectangular
polygon which is projected (look
[here](../../../../../proj4/src/main/scalageotrellis/proj4) for more
on projection). This is useful mainly as a tool for defining the
extent covered by a tile - the two jointly yield a raster (for more
on rasters, go [here](../../../../../raster/src/main/scalageotrellis/raster)).
Constructing these bad boys is pretty easy. Since they're rectangles,
we only need to provide four unique points. Take a look at this source:
From Extent.scala:

```scala
case class Extent(xmin: Double, ymin: Double, xmax: Double, ymax: Double)
```

Not too shabby. But remember that the real sweet spot for these is
their built in support for handling projections (seriously: go look
at the link from above regarding projection if this is fuzzy).

From Extent.scala:

```scala
case class ProjectedExtent(extent: Extent, crs: CRS) {
  def reproject(dest: CRS): Extent = extent.reproject(crs, dest)
}
```

Really, that's about all you need to know to get started with
extents. They're a powerful tool for a tightly defined task.

##Submodules

These submodules define useful methods for dealing with
the entities that call `geotrellis.vector` home:
- `geotrellis.vector.io` defines input/output (serialization) of geometries
- `geotrellis.vector.op` defines common operations on geometries
- `geotrellis.vector.reproject` defines methods for translating between projections
