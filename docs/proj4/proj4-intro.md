# geotrellis.proj4

This module includes a slightly modified version of the proj4
java port, proj4j, as well as a lightweight scala wrapper around
its projection facilities. When reading the source keep in mind
that `Transform` is just a type alias.  

From 'package.scala':

```scala
package object proj4 {
  type Transform = (Double, Double) => (Double, Double)
}
```
