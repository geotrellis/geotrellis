/**
 * Create a histogram from double values in a raster.
 *
 * FastMapHistogram only works with integer values, which is great for performance
 * but means that, in order to use FastMapHistogram with double values, each value 
 * must be multiplied by a power of ten to preserve significant fractional digits.
 *
 * For example, if you want to save one significant digit (2.1 from 2.123), set
 * sigificantDigits to 1, and the histogram will save 2.1 as "21" by multiplying
 * each value by 10.  The multiplier is 10 raised to the power of significant digits
 * (e.g. 1 digit: 10, 2 digits: 100, and so on).
 *
 * Important: Be sure that the maximum value in the rater multiplied by 
 *            10 ^ significantDigits does not overflow Int.MaxValue (2,147,483,647). 
 *
 * @param r                   Raster to create histogram from
 * @param significantDigits   Number of significant digits to preserve by multiplying
