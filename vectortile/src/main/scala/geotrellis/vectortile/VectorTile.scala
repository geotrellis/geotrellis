/** A high-level representation of a Vector Tile. At its simplest, a Tile is
  * just a collection of Layers. We opt to expose each Layer name at the Tile
  * level, as the keys of a [[Map]]. This way, if the layer names are known by
  * the user ahead of time, they can search through the Tile quickly.
  *
  * Traditionally, VectorTiles are encoded as Protobuf data, which this library
  * provides a codec for. However, by making this top-level type a trait, we
  * are able to define alternative backends (GeoJson, for instance).
  *
  * See [[geotrellis.vectortile.protobuf.ProtobufTile]] for more information
  * on how to decode and encode VectorTiles.
